# 1C Metadata Manage — Skill Dispatch

Use this skill when the task involves **1C metadata structure**: creating, editing, validating, or removing configuration objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions, or databases. Do **not** use for general BSL code writing or business logic implementation.

## Dispatch Strategy

Determine task complexity, then choose the execution mode:

### Direct execution — simple / read-only tasks

Use when the task is a **single lightweight query**: checking metadata info, a quick lookup, one validation call. In this case identify the task domain from the table below, read the corresponding file, and follow its instructions directly.

### Subagent delegation — complex / mutation tasks

Delegate to the **`/metadata-manager`** subagent (defined in `@agents/metadata-manager.md`) when **any** of the following is true:

- The task **creates, scaffolds, or compiles** metadata (objects, forms, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, CF, CFE, databases)
- The task **edits multiple files** or **spans multiple domains**
- The task involves a **multi-step workflow** (create → edit → validate → fix → re-validate)
- The task requires **reading large domain docs** (forms, meta-manage, SKD, MXL, roles, EPF, DB — each 200–800 lines)

The subagent already knows how to read the skill docs, execute PowerShell scripts, and validate results. Provide it with the full task description including object names, attributes, types, and any business context from the conversation.

## Task Domain Table

| Task Domain | Keywords | File |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata objects — create, edit, analyze, remove, validate | catalog, document, register, enum, constant, module, attribute, tabular section | [meta-manage.md](docs/meta-manage.md) |
| Managed forms — design, create, edit, analyze, validate | form, Form.xml, UI, elements, commands, events | [form-manage.md](docs/form-manage.md) |
| Data Composition Schema (DCS/SKD) — create, edit, analyze, validate | report, DCS, SKD, data composition, data set, query | [skd-manage.md](docs/skd-manage.md) |
| Spreadsheet documents (MXL) — create, decompile, analyze, validate | MXL, spreadsheet, template, print form, layout | [mxl-manage.md](docs/mxl-manage.md) |
| Roles and access rights — create, analyze, validate | role, rights, RLS, access, permissions | [role-manage.md](docs/role-manage.md) |
| External processors/reports (EPF/ERF) — scaffold, build, dump, validate | EPF, ERF, data processor, external report, build, dump | [epf-manage.md](docs/epf-manage.md) |
| BSP/SSL registration and commands | BSP, SSL, ExternalDataProcessorInfo, registration, command | [bsp-manage.md](docs/bsp-manage.md) |
| Configuration (CF) — create, edit, analyze, validate | configuration, Configuration.xml, CF | [cf-manage.md](docs/cf-manage.md) |
| Extensions (CFE) — create, borrow, diff, patch, validate | extension, CFE, borrow, interceptor, patch | [cfe-manage.md](docs/cfe-manage.md) |
| Databases — registry, create, run, load, dump | database, infobase, .v8-project.json, create DB, run 1C | [db-manage.md](docs/db-manage.md) |
| Subsystems — create, edit, analyze, validate | subsystem, command interface, ChildObjects | [subsystem-manage.md](docs/subsystem-manage.md) |
| Command interface — edit, validate | CommandInterface.xml, commands visibility, groups | [interface-manage.md](docs/interface-manage.md) |
| Templates/layouts management — add, remove | template, layout, SpreadsheetDocument, HTML template | [template-manage.md](docs/template-manage.md) |
| Help pages — add, manage | help, built-in help, documentation | [help-manage.md](docs/help-manage.md) |
| SSL/BSP subsystems patterns | SSL patterns, standard subsystems, BSP events | [ssl-patterns.md](docs/ssl-patterns.md) |
| Query optimization | query, temporary table, join, DCS optimization | [query-optimization.md](docs/query-optimization.md) |

**If the task spans multiple domains**, the subagent will read all relevant docs automatically (or read each one directly for simple tasks).
